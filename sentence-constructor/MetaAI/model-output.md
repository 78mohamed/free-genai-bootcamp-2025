## Interpretation of Your Attempt

Your translation is:  
**(Kuma ga doa no mae ni imasu, gomi o noka ni oki wasuremashita ka?)**  
This translates to:  
**"Bears are in front of the door, did you forget to put the garbage outside?"**

## Feedback
Great job! Your translation is very close to the original sentence. Here are a few minor suggestions:

- Instead of "dōa" (ドア), you can use "tobira" (トビラ) to say "door."
- To make the sentence more natural-sounding, you can change the word order to:
  **(Kuma ga tobira no mae ni imasu. Gomi o noka ni oki wasuremashita ka?)**
  This breaks the sentence into two separate sentences, which is more common in Japanese.
