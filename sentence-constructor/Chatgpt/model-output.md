#### **Sentence Structure Hints**  
1. **"Bears are at the door"**  
   - Use the verb "to be (for living things)."  
   - "Door" is a location, so think about how to mark it properly.  

2. **"Did you leave the garbage out?"**  
   - The verb for "to put out" needs to be in past tense.  
   - Since it's a question, you need the proper question-ending particle.  

---

#### **Clues, Considerations, Next Steps**  
- Remember that in Japanese, subjects (like "you") are often omitted unless necessary for clarity.  
- Think about how to structure the sentence naturally in two parts: one statement and one question.  
- Look at the vocabulary table and identify the correct verb forms needed.  
- Once you make an attempt, I’ll help refine it!  

Try transcribing the sentence, and I’ll check your attempt! 😊

# Asking for Clues

can you give me a clue?

### **State: Clues**  

Here are some clues to help you out:  

- For **"Bears are at the door,"** use the verb that expresses the presence of living things. In Japanese, locations usually come **before** the verb.  
- The phrase **"Did you leave the garbage out?"** needs past tense. The verb **"to put out"** should be in its past form.  
- To turn a sentence into a **yes/no question**, use the **question marker** at the end.  
- In casual speech, **"you"** is often omitted because it's understood from context.  

💡 **Example sentence for reference:**  
- **"The cat is under the table."** → 猫はテーブルの下にいる。  

Try using this pattern to structure your attempt! 😊

# Attempt

### **State: Attempt**  

Great attempt! Let's break it down:  

#### **Your Sentence Interpretation**  
**クマがドアの前にいます、ゴミを外に置き忘れましたか？**  
- **クマがドアの前にいます** → "The bear is in front of the door." ✅ (Good structure!)  
- **ゴミを外に置き忘れましたか？** → "Did you forget to place the garbage outside?" (Not quite the same as "Did you leave the garbage out?")  

---

### **Corrections & Feedback**  
1. **クマがドアの前にいます**  
   - This is **grammatically correct**, but **ドアの前** (in front of the door) is slightly different from just **at the door**.  
   - You can keep this, or you can simplify it to **ドアにいます** ("at the door").  

2. **ゴミを外に置き忘れましたか？**  
   - **置き忘れる** means "to forget to place," which implies **forgetting to put** the garbage outside rather than just **leaving it out**.  
   - Instead, use **出す** ("to put out") in past tense.  

---

### **Suggested Revision**
**クマがドアにいます。ゴミを出しましたか？**  
- More natural and direct!  
- Uses **出す** ("to put out") instead of **置き忘れる** ("to forget to place"), making the meaning clearer.  

---

### **Next Steps**  
- Try rewriting the second sentence with **出す** in past tense.  
- Do you want to make it more polite or casual? Right now, it's neutral/formal.  

Give it another try! 😊
